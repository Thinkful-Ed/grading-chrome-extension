- Go to any submission that you've claimed from the grading queue and the snippet will be added
 on page load. It will automatically adapt to the program you selected.
- Changing the program while grading will automatically re-populate the text field, this is 
useful to avoid refreshing the page, but be careful as it will override anything you wrote before.
- You can also customize the intro message from the default to your own.
